<p class = "a"> Hello this html page was created by four of the girls that attented Girls
   Who Code Summer immersion program 2019 at Alkami.
   Our names are Deysy Sanchez , Rania Krourou, Raulina Rodriguez, Cece Barronville :)!!
We were able to work on this HTML page for our final project within are final two weeks.
Our main goal for this site was to inform our society about really awesome places that are fun to explore.
Through this not only can it help tourists but also helps the people that currently live around the area.
This webpage allows you to see photos of the destination but also it shows how to get there and places that
are near that area, this includes restaurants and shopping centers like small stores. </p>

<p><font size="4"> Boston is one of the most historically abundant cities in the United States.
  Boston, Massachusetts is known as the birthplace of the American Revolution because many historic
  events took place there during the revolution.This is why many tourits come to Boston to experience
   history from the past but the big problem is that they have to do a lot of research to go to certain areas.
   This webiste was built to make it easier for tourists to know where to go and what are the famous places you cannot miss out but also get reviews before you go there,
   and be able to know what to expect when you go around this area.Also this will help you know how to get the right direction and ways to transport to get to the destination.
